# Professional Self-Assessment
## Introduction
###### 11 December 2024

This Professional Self-Assessment summarizes my experiences navigating the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) and introduces the artifacts selected for my final Capstone project. These artifacts reflect the growth and skills I have developed throughout this program.

## My Educational Journey
I began my academic journey at SNHU in 2018 with the initial goal of earning an Associate's Degree (CCAF) from the Community College of the Air Force. At the time, I had served approximately six years in the Air Force and had recently been promoted to Staff Sergeant (SSgt). Feeling the need for growth and a challenge, I decided to pursue my longstanding interest in software programming.

I have always had a passion for solving puzzles and creating things, and programming felt like a natural fit. This decision was transformative, sparking a new direction in my career and life aspirations.

## Program Reflection
The Computer Science program at SNHU has significantly impacted my technical knowledge and personal growth. Before starting, I had little understanding of the complexities behind software development. Two courses that had a particularly profound influence on me were **CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms** and **CS-330: Computer Graphics and Visualization**.

###### CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms
This course emphasized the importance of data structures and algorithms in software development. I learned how data structures organize and manage data efficiently, reducing redundancy and making debugging far easier. Proper use of data structures ensures cleaner, more maintainable code.

Algorithms, meanwhile, are essential for solving problems logically and efficiently. They underpin processes such as data sorting, resource management, and search functionality. Mastering these concepts was pivotal in shaping how I approach problem-solving and optimization in programming.

###### CS-330: Computer Graphics and Visualization
I was particularly excited about this course, and it exceeded my expectations. Early projects included creating movable 3D objects, such as a pyramid. As the course progressed, I developed more complex artifacts, like a rotating "sun" around the pyramid, which gave me insight into the fundamentals of game development.

For my final project in CS-330, I created a scene featuring a log cabin by a lake, surrounded by mountains and pine trees. While there was room for improvement in my design, this project ignited my interest in pursuing a career in game development.

## Final Portfolio Summary
Throughout the program, I discovered not only a passion for creating software but also a particular interest in developing educational games. For my Capstone project, I revisited and enhanced a program I had previously developed, focusing on improving its playability and functionality.

###### Key updates included:
**New Game Mode:** I added a mode that challenges players with shorter response times, ideal for advanced learners.

**Code Refinement:** I thoroughly reviewed and cleaned up the codebase, addressing vulnerabilities and improving maintainability.

**High Score Feature:** I implemented a SQL database to track high scores, creating a competitive element to engage users and encourage replayability.

This project exemplifies my growth as a programmer and my commitment to creating engaging, educational experiences.
